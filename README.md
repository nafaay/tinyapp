This app will let users to shorten long URLs.
A user can register and/or log in with its email and password.
A logged-in user can create, update, delete and visulaise all 
the urls that belong to him.
In this app we worked only with objects simulating a database.
Short URLs are simulated with a helper function that can get a random 
text in which the characters are alphanumeric.
